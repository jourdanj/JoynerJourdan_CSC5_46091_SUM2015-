<Start> Bedroom

<Bedroom>
You are in a bedroom that isn't yours. The  bed is soft, the lights are dim and 
you can hear the dull hum of a radio from somewhere else in the house.
There is a door to your right [east]. Beside it resides a large |bookcase|.*

<Bedroom|bookcase>
The bookcase reaches to the ceiling, with shelf upon shelf of books to enjoy. You notice a beaten up
journal slightly hanging out. You open it up to discover a single line written within it.
<#1 21,17,18,14,15,11,12,__.>*

<Hallway>
The Hallway is long and narrow and the door to the bedroom [west]
creaks loudly as it closes. The lights flicker eerily as 
you move through it. There seems to be an opening and a |door| at the end of the hall,
the opening going forward [north] and the door on the left [east]. The radio can
be heard coming from the other side of the door, and it seems that there is a note left stuck to it.*

<Hallway|door>
The note on the door is one line. It reads:
"#4 What is the number that is one half of one quarter of one tenth of 400?*

<LivingRoom>
The north Hallway [south] door opens and you enter the living room. It is spacious and has a very cozy
feel to it. There are many comfortable sofas around a large coffee table and expensive looking |art| hangs from the walls.
The only window is a skylight, shining in the warm rays of the sun. The front door on the wall to the right [east] seems to have been hastily
boarded up. The entrance to the kitchen [west] is to the left.*

<LivingRoom2>
The north Hallway [south] door opens and you enter the living room. It is spacious and has a very cozy
feel to it. There are many comfortable sofas around a large coffee table. The only window is a skylight,
letting in the warm rays of the sun. The front door on the wall to the right [east] seems to have been hastily
boarded up. The entrance to the kitchen [west] is to the left. The safe lies on the [north] wall as the |art|
formerly covering it lays upon the ground*

<LivingRoom|art>
You go to straighten one of the more entrancing pieces of art but it falls to the ground. Hidden behind it 
you find a safe.*

<LivingRoom2|art>
You broke the artwork's frame when it fell. Hopefully it wasn't expensive...*

<Kitchen>
Moving through the living room, [east] You cautiously enter the empty kitchen. The |cabinets| are open 
and empty, as though recently searched. The glass back door [west] has been boarded up as well.
There is a fridge [north] siting upon the opposite wall, closed and unassuming.*
<north> Fridge

<Kitchen|cabinets>
You go through the cabinets, making sure there is nothing there to help you with your search. During your search you
find a playing card. It is a 4 of spades, and written on the back in black sharpie is "#2". You leave the 
card in the drawer, its not much use to you.*

<Fridge>
The refridgerator hums with power. The inside of the fridge is empty, except for some condiments.
On the outside of the fridge, there is a |picture| of a family of 4 at the beach.*

<Fridge|picture>
You take the picture from the fridge to get a better look at it. As you hold it in your hands you turn 
it over to discover a riddle on the other side. It reads: 
"#3 Four years ago, Jane was twice as old as Sam. Four years on from now,
Sam will be 3/4 of Jane's age. How old is Jane now?" You, obviously having no time for riddles, put the 
picture back where you found it.*

<Office>
Inside the office you hear the you see the walls lined with books and an impressive mahognony desk. 
Atop the desk rests the rests the |radio|, currently playing Etta James' rendition of 'At Last'. Behind the desk [north],
you see an open window.*

<Office|radio>
"At laaaaaaast
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song..."*

<Window>
You look out the window to make sure the coast is clear. Everything checks out, so you climb out the window and proceed
to hop the back yard fence. You have escaped the house.*
