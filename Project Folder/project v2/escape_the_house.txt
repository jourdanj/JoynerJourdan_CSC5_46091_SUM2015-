<Start> Bedroom

<Bedroom>
You are in a bedroom that isn't yours. The  bed is soft, the lights are dim and 
you can hear the dull hum of a radio from somewhere else in the house.
There is a door to your right [east]. Beside it resides a large bookcase.*

<Hallway>
The Hallway is long and narrow and the door to the bedroom [west]
creaks loudly as it closes. The lights flicker eerily as 
you move through it. There seems to be an opening and a door at the end of the hall,
the opening going forward [north] and the door on the left [east]. The radio can
be heard coming from the other side of the door*

<LivingRoom>
The north Hallway [south] door opens and you enter the living room. It is spacious and has a very cozy
feel to it. There are many comfortable sofas and expensive looking art hangs from the walls. 
The only window is a skylight, shining in the warm rays of the sun. The front door stands on the wall to the right
[east] and the entrance to the kitchen [west] is to the left*

<Kitchen>
Moving through the living room, [east] You cautiously enter the empty kitchen. The cabinets are open 
and empty, as though recently searched. The glass back door [west] has been boarded over.
There is a fridge [north] siting upon the opposite wall, closed and unassuming.*

<Fridge>
The refridgerator hums with power. The inside of the fridge is empty, except for some condiments.
On the outside of the fridge, there is a picture of a lighthouse overlooking a vast ocean.
