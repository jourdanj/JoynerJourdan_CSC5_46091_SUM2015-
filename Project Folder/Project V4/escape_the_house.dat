<Bedroom>
You are in a bedroom that isn't yours. The  bed is soft, the lights are dim and 
you can hear the dull hum of a radio from somewhere else in the house.
There is a door to your right [east]. Beside it resides a large |bookcase|.*

<Bedroom|bookcase>
The bookcase reaches to the ceiling, with shelf upon shelf of books to enjoy. You notice a beaten up
journal slightly hanging out. You open it up to discover a single line written within it.
<1- 21,16,17,12,13,8,9,4,__.>*

<Hallway>
The Hallway is long and narrow and the door to the bedroom [west] creaks loudly as it closes. 
The lights flicker eerily as you move through it. There seems to be an opening and a |door| at
the end of the hall, the opening going forward [north] and the door on the left [east]. The radio can
be heard coming from the other side of the door, and it seems that there is a note left stuck to it.*

<Hallway|door>
The note on the door is one line. It reads:
<4- What is the number that is one half of one quarter of one tenth of 400?>*

<LivingRoom>
The Hallway [south] opens up into the living room. It is spacious and has a very cozy
feel to it. There are many comfortable sofas around a large coffee table and expensive looking |art| hangs from the walls.
The only window is a skylight, shining in the warm rays of the sun. The front door on the wall to the right [east] seems to have been hastily
boarded up. The entrance to the kitchen [west] is to the left.*

<LivingRoom|art>
The art in the room is pretty strange, the "painting" you are currently looking at seems to be a single
black streak diagonally across a white canvas. Hopefully whoever owns the place didnt pay much.*

<Kitchen>
Moving through the living room, [east] You cautiously enter the empty kitchen. The |cabinets| are open 
and empty, as though recently searched. The glass back door [west] has been boarded up as well. One the wall
perpendicular to the blocked off glass is what appeas to be a garage door [south].
There is a fridge [north] siting upon the opposite wall, closed and unassuming.*

<Kitchen|cabinets>
You go through the cabinets, making sure there is nothing there to help you with your search. During your search you
find a playing card. It is an ace of spades, and written on the back in black sharpie is "#5". You leave the 
card in the drawer, its not much use to you.*

<Fridge>
The refridgerator hums with power. The inside of the fridge is empty, except for some condiments.
On the outside of the fridge, there is a |picture| of a family of 4 at the beach.*

<Fridge|picture>
You take the picture from the fridge to get a better look at it. As you hold it in your hands you turn 
it over to discover a riddle on the other side. It reads: 
"<3- Four years ago, Jane was twice as old as Sam. Four years on from now,
Sam will be 3/4 of Jane's age. How old is Jane now?>" You, obviously having no time for riddles, put the 
picture back where you found it.*

<Garage>
You step into a 2 car garage, although currently no cars inhabit the building. there is a |washer| and dryer
just to the right of the door and there seems to be a variety of objects in the shelves. The garage |doors| 
are on the wall to the left, while the shelves line the wall directly ahead [north] of you. There is also a 
garage door |button| just on the wall of the door you came in through.*

<Garage|washer>
The washer is empty, so is the dryer for that matter.*

<Garage|doors>
You try to lift the garage doors but they don't budge an inch.*

<Garage|button>
You try to open the garage door by hitting the button but nothing happens.*

<Shelves>
It looks like whoever lives here has been keeping a lot of random junk in storage out here. Without even 
touching anything you can spot |books|, clothes, a |guitar|, and an old |ipad|. In between
the shelving units [north] there also appears to be a wall safe.*

<south> Garage
<west> None

<Shelves|books>
Theres a collection of old comptuer science text books for old languages. Who uses FORTRAN anymore??*

<Shelves|guitar>
You, being a natural on the guitar since birth, obviously decide to play a few quick riffs on the old guitar.
After running through a perfect performance of Jimi Hendrix' Voodoo Child, you realize you should probably
get back to the task at hand.*

<Shelves|ipad>
"What a strange place to keep an ipad," you think to yourself as you pick up the ipad from the shelf. You try to unlock
it but the screen isnt prompting you to open it. Its actually not displaying anything a regular ipad would. you decide to
hit it a few times. and the screen pops on. It displays these words:*

<Office>
Inside the office you hear the you see the walls lined with books and an impressive mahognony desk. 
Atop the desk rests the rests the |radio|, currently playing Etta James' rendition of 'At Last'. Behind the desk [north],
you see an open window.*
<north> Window

<south> Hallway
<west> None
<view> 1 radio 

<Office|radio>
"At laaaaaaast
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song..."*

<Window>
You look out the window to make sure the coast is clear. Everything checks out, so you climb out the window and proceed
to hop the back yard fence. You have escaped the house.*
